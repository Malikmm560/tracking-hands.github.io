✋ Hand Tracking with Python, OpenCV & Mediapipe
So this project is a basic hand-tracking setup built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe. It’s simple right now, but there’s a lot you can customize here if you’re looking to build more advanced stuff! Perfect if you’re starting with hand tracking or just want to play around with real-time hand detection. Here’s a breakdown:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⚙️ What It Does

1. Tracks your hand in real-time through the webcam
2. Uses Mediapipe for hand landmarks (finger joints, wrist, etc.)
3. Built with OpenCV for video processing and display
4. Super simple code that you can build off or just use as-is
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🛠 How to Get Started
1. Clone this repository:

-git clone https://github.com/Malikmm560/tracking-hands.git

2. Install OpenCV and Mediapipe

-pip install opencv-python mediapipe

3. Run the script:

-python tracking-hand.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔧 Customizations & Ideas
Gesture Recognition: Customize the script to detect specific hand signs or gestures, like a thumbs-up 👍 or a peace sign ✌️.
VR/AR Projects: Use this as a base for a VR or AR setup with hand-tracking interactions 🕶️.
Sign Language Recognition: Could expand this to recognize parts of sign language movements 👋.
🚀 What You Can Add
This is just the starting point! You could add:

Multiple hand tracking 🤲
Controls based on gestures (maybe control music with hand signs? 🎶)
Interaction with virtual objects (perfect for creative projects) 💡
